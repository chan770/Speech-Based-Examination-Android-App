# Speech-Based-Examination-Android-App
An Android application to assist virtually and physically challenged students in taking their exams. The application reads questions to the students, captures their spoken answers, evaluates them, and displays the results, reducing their reliance on volunteers and providing a more accessible exam-taking experience
The Speech Based Examination Android Application is a technological solution designed to address the challenges faced by virtually and physically challenged students when taking exams. Developed using Java programming language, this Android application aims to reduce the workload and dependency on volunteers by providing a more accessible and automated exam-taking experience.

The introduction highlights the evolution of smartphones and their role in enhancing various aspects of daily life, including education. It emphasizes the importance of technological advancements in improving the lives of students with disabilities, particularly in the context of taking exams. The Android platform, based on the Linux foundation, is described as a versatile operating system that offers a rich application framework for developers.

The paper recognizes the need for trustworthy and confidential volunteers to assist disabled students during exams. It also acknowledges the difficulty volunteers face in explaining visual elements such as diagrams and flowcharts to students. To address these challenges, the authors propose an Android application that leverages speech recognition and synthesis technologies. The application reads exam questions to the students using text-to-speech functionality, captures their spoken answers through speech-to-text conversion, evaluates the answers, and calculates the marks.

The system overview section provides a detailed description of the application's architecture and functionality. It explains the process flow, starting from the login stage for faculty members to the student login, subject selection, question reading, answer capture, evaluation, and result display.

The literature review section briefly discusses related works, such as Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Recognition technologies, highlighting their capabilities and benefits in the context of speech processing. The authors also mention the use of Firebase for user authentication and Google's speech engine for speech synthesis and recognition.

The result and analysis section presents the outcomes of implementing the application. It discusses the successful authentication process, question reading, answer capture, evaluation, and result display. The code snippets provided offer insights into the implementation details.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of the Speech Based Examination Android Application in improving the lives of disabled students by providing a more independent and efficient exam-taking experience. It highlights the scalability and compatibility of the application with a wide range of Android devices and suggests future possibilities for its use in other interactive applications aimed at enhancing the well-being of disabled individuals.

Overall, the paper showcases the benefits and features of the proposed Android application, demonstrating its potential to alleviate the challenges faced by virtually and physically challenged students during exams, ultimately empowering them to participate more fully in the educational process.
